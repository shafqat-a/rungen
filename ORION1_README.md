## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+ with virtual environment
2. API keys for:
   - Groq (`GROQ_API_KEY`)
   - Google AI (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
   - OpenAI/Moonshot (`OPEN_AI_KEY`)
   - DeepSeek (`DEEPKEY_API_KEY`)

### Setup
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source rungen/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test team creation
python test_orion1.py

# Run team demonstration
python orion1_team.py
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### 1. Team Meeting
```python
from orion1_models import create_orion1_team
import asyncio

async def team_meeting():
    team = create_orion1_team()
    
    # Your meeting topic
    topic = "Weekly Sprint Planning and Risk Assessment"
    
    # Run team discussion
    await run_team_meeting(topic, team)

asyncio.run(team_meeting())
```

### 2. Project Planning
```python
async def project_planning():
    team = create_orion1_team()
    
    project = "E-commerce Platform with Real-time Analytics"
    await run_project_planning(project, team)
```

### 3. Code Review
```python
async def code_review():
    team = create_orion1_team()
    
    code = """
    async function processPayment(paymentData) {
        // Your code here
    }
    """
    
    await run_code_review_session(code, team)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Supported Providers
- **Groq**: Fast inference with Llama models
- **Google**: Advanced reasoning with Gemini models
- **Moonshot AI**: Specialized coding capabilities
- **DeepSeek**: Strong testing and analysis skills
- **OpenAI**: General-purpose capabilities

### Model Configuration
Edit `orion1_models.py` to customize:
- Team member models
- System messages/roles
- Provider settings

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required API Keys
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key  
OPEN_AI_KEY=your_openai_key
DEEPKEY_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key

# Optional settings
DEFAULT_GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
AUTOGEN_WORKSPACE=workspace
```

## üéØ Team Scenarios

The Orion1 team can handle various software development scenarios:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Weekly planning and risk assessment
2. **Project Kickoff**: New project planning and architecture
3. **Code Reviews**: Multi-perspective code analysis
4. **Bug Triage**: Issue analysis and resolution planning
5. **Technical Discussions**: Architecture and design decisions
6. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive QA planning with Playwright

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Team Members
```python
# In orion1_models.py
new_member = create_agent(
    name="Your_Role",
    model="your_preferred_model",
    system_message="Your role description...",
    provider="your_provider"
)
```

### Changing Models
Update the `ORION1_MODELS` dictionary in `orion1_models.py`:
```python
ORION1_MODELS = {
    "principal_decision_maker": "your_preferred_model",
    # ... other roles
}
```

### Custom Workflows
Create new functions in `orion1_team.py` for specific workflows:
```python
async def custom_workflow(task, team):
    # Your custom team interaction logic
    pass
```

## üìä Performance Notes

- **Groq models**: Fastest inference, good for decision-making
- **Gemini models**: Best for complex reasoning and architecture
- **Moonshot models**: Excellent for coding tasks
- **DeepSeek models**: Strong analytical capabilities for testing

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Errors**: Verify all keys in `.env` file
2. **Import Errors**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Model Timeouts**: Some models may be slower than others
4. **Rate Limits**: Each provider has different rate limits

### Testing
```bash
# Test individual components
python test_orion1.py

# Test specific providers
python -c "from orion1_models import MultiProviderConfig; config = MultiProviderConfig(); print('‚úÖ Config OK')"
```

## üéâ Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly:
- ‚úÖ All API keys validated
- ‚úÖ Team members created successfully  
- ‚úÖ Multi-provider model access
- ‚úÖ Conversation flows working
- ‚úÖ Role-based responses from each agent

The Orion1 team is now ready for real software development projects! üöÄ
